Emotion Detector
A basic emotion detection system using Python, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision.

🧠 Abstract
The Emotion Detector project leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to recognize human emotions based on facial expressions. By analyzing facial features, the system predicts emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more. This project combines data preprocessing, feature extraction, and deep learning to achieve reliable emotion recognition.

📌 Introduction
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify human emotions from facial expressions. Facial emotion recognition has applications in fields like mental health monitoring, human-computer interaction, and entertainment. The goal is to build a system capable of real-time emotion classification using a webcam.

🔍 Project Overview
Data Collection & Preprocessing
Facial images are categorized by emotion and prepared for training.

Feature Extraction
Images are resized to 48x48 pixels, converted to grayscale, and normalized.

Model Training
A CNN is trained to classify images into seven emotions:

Angry

Disgust

Fear

Happy

Neutral

Sad

Surprise

Real-Time Detection
The trained model is integrated with a webcam for live emotion recognition.
